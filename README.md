# 360VideoWebpage
This program allows users to create a series of 360 videos that are navigatable by buttons without coding. Users will download the 7z file and unzip it

To create a series of videos go into the New Unity Project_Data folder and go to StreamingAssets. Drag and drop all your 360 videos (compressed and in .mp4 format) into this folder.
Then launch the app and click on edit mode. Put in the names of the videos in order of what youd like to appear. 
Note the delete button can be used if pieces are out of order. Use the forward and backwards buttons to see the current order. 

Then send the entire folder you downloaded to your ideal audience and tell them to click on view mode. 
It will store all data from your project and allow them to see what you created.
